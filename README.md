# assessment-mode-bypass

## Installation

Owing the google's increasing attempts to force developers to pay the "Web Store" fee, installing an extension (with out the store) is a rather manual process.

First download this repo as a ZIP file, and extract it.

Then go to [chrome://extensions/](chrome://extensions/), and ensure "Developer mode" is on.

![Chromium's Extension page with developer mode enabled](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/45378255/168331520-9431ea70-673f-42c6-85ec-9ca09da95ea5.png)

Finlay click "Load unpacked extension", and select the folder in witch you unpacked the ZIP file.

## Using

Right before you click start, open the Extension menu and click on the "Assessment Mode Bypass" extension to give it access to the page.

Then just take the assessment.

## Why?

Because I was annoyed having to un-fullscreen the browser to access a decent calculator (the one in the assessment is very hard to use). This extension does make it slightly easier to cheat, but it's not like you couldn't cheat with the "Assessment Mode" extension.
